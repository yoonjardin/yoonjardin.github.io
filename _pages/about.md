Hi!! 

I am currently pursuing the M.S. degree in Computer Engineering at the [AISLAb](https://sites.google.com/view/aishongik),  [Hongik University](https://www.hongik.ac.kr/kr/index.do/), Seoul, South Korea. I also received the B.S. degree in Computer Engineering at Hongik University. 

My research focuses include Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Software Engineering
